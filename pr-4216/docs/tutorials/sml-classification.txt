1b:T408,The plot confirms the expected scaling pattern. The classical AdaBoost performs strongly for smaller ensembles but becomes increasingly costly to scale as the number of weak learners grows, because its subset-selection problem expands combinatorially. The quantum-enhanced models replicate classical accuracy at low widths and begin to surpass it as ensemble size increases, especially under adaptive α-regularization. This reflects the quantum optimizer’s ability to sample and evaluate many candidate subsets in parallel through superposition, maintaining tractable search even at higher widths. While current hardware overhead offsets some of the theoretical gains, the trend illustrates the scaling efficiency advantage of the quantum formulation. In practical terms, the classical method remains preferable for lightweight benchmarks, while quantum-enhanced ensembles become advantageous as model dimensionality and ensemble size expand, offering better trade-offs between accuracy, generalization, and computational growth.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-[1fr,auto] relative","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-app max-w-[var(--main-container-max-width)]","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"pt-16 px-16 xlg:px-32 bg-layer z-10 sticky top-[var(--app-header-height)] flex flex-col gap-[12px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded border border-yellow-30/30 dark:border-yellow-30 bg-yellow-10 dark:bg-cool-gray-100","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start gap-8 px-16 py-[12px]","children":[["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"var(--cds-support-warning)","aria-hidden":true,"width":"16","height":"16","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","className":"flex-shrink-0 mt-[1px] [&_path[data-icon-path='inner-path']]:fill-[#000] [&_path[data-icon-path='inner-path']]:opacity-100","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M8,1C4.2,1,1,4.2,1,8s3.2,7,7,7s7-3.1,7-7S11.9,1,8,1z M7.5,4h1v5h-1C7.5,9,7.5,4,7.5,4z M8,12.2 c-0.4,0-0.8-0.4-0.8-0.8s0.3-0.8,0.8-0.8c0.4,0,0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8S8.4,12.2,8,12.2z"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M7.5,4h1v5h-1C7.5,9,7.5,4,7.5,4z M8,12.2c-0.4,0-0.8-0.4-0.8-0.8s0.3-0.8,0.8-0.8 c0.4,0,0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8S8.4,12.2,8,12.2z","data-icon-path":"inner-path","opacity":"0"}],"$undefined"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-body-01 text-text-primary","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"text-heading-compact-01","children":"This is a preview build of IBM Quantum® documentation."}]," ","Refer to ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline","children":"quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs"}]," for the official documentation."]}]]}]}]}],["$","main",null,{"id":"main-content","className":"mx-16 md:mx-96 lg:mx-[56px] xlg:mx-96 pb-96 pt-0 max-w-full md:max-w-[800px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose","children":[["\n",["$","h1",null,{"id":"hybrid-quantum-enhanced-ensemble-classification-grid-stability-workflow","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] [overflow-wrap:anywhere] text-heading-06 text-text-primary","children":["Hybrid quantum-enhanced ensemble classification (grid stability workflow)",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","href":"#hybrid-quantum-enhanced-ensemble-classification-grid-stability-workflow","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline heading-permalink ml-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M29.25,6.76a6,6,0,0,0-8.5,0l1.42,1.42a4,4,0,1,1,5.67,5.67l-8,8a4,4,0,1,1-5.67-5.66l1.41-1.42-1.41-1.42-1.42,1.42a6,6,0,0,0,0,8.5A6,6,0,0,0,17,25a6,6,0,0,0,4.27-1.76l8-8A6,6,0,0,0,29.25,6.76Z"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M4.19,24.82a4,4,0,0,1,0-5.67l8-8a4,4,0,0,1,5.67,0A3.94,3.94,0,0,1,19,14a4,4,0,0,1-1.17,2.85L15.71,19l1.42,1.42,2.12-2.12a6,6,0,0,0-8.51-8.51l-8,8a6,6,0,0,0,0,8.51A6,6,0,0,0,7,28a6.07,6.07,0,0,0,4.28-1.76L9.86,24.82A4,4,0,0,1,4.19,24.82Z"}],"$undefined"]}]}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["$","em",null,{"children":"Usage estimate: 20 minutes in QPU time for each job on an Eagle r3 processor.
