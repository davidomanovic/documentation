1b:T402,With the release of a new major version, the previous major version is supported
for at least six months with only bug fixes, and one year for security fixes. During
this time only patch releases are published for this major version.
A final patch version is published when support is dropped, and that release
also documents the end of support for that major version series. A longer
support window is needed for the previous major version as this gives downstream
Qiskit consumers and their users a chance to migrate their code.
Downstream libraries that
depend on Qiskit should not raise their minimum required Qiskit version to a new
major version immediately after its release because the library's user base needs time
to migrate to the new API changes. Having an extended support window
for the previous major Qiskit version gives downstream projects time to ensure
compatibility with the next major version. Downstream projects can provide
support for two release series at a time to give their users a migration path.2:["$","div",null,{"className":"grid grid-cols-[1fr,auto] relative","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"min-h-app max-w-[var(--main-container-max-width)]","children":[["$","div",null,{"className":"pt-16 px-16 xlg:px-32 bg-layer z-10 sticky top-[var(--app-header-height)] flex flex-col gap-[12px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"rounded border border-yellow-30/30 dark:border-yellow-30 bg-yellow-10 dark:bg-cool-gray-100","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"flex items-start gap-8 px-16 py-[12px]","children":[["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"var(--cds-support-warning)","aria-hidden":true,"width":"16","height":"16","viewBox":"0 0 16 16","className":"flex-shrink-0 mt-[1px] [&_path[data-icon-path='inner-path']]:fill-[#000] [&_path[data-icon-path='inner-path']]:opacity-100","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M8,1C4.2,1,1,4.2,1,8s3.2,7,7,7s7-3.1,7-7S11.9,1,8,1z M7.5,4h1v5h-1C7.5,9,7.5,4,7.5,4z M8,12.2 c-0.4,0-0.8-0.4-0.8-0.8s0.3-0.8,0.8-0.8c0.4,0,0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8S8.4,12.2,8,12.2z"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M7.5,4h1v5h-1C7.5,9,7.5,4,7.5,4z M8,12.2c-0.4,0-0.8-0.4-0.8-0.8s0.3-0.8,0.8-0.8 c0.4,0,0.8,0.4,0.8,0.8S8.4,12.2,8,12.2z","data-icon-path":"inner-path","opacity":"0"}],"$undefined"]}],["$","div",null,{"className":"text-body-01 text-text-primary","children":[["$","span",null,{"className":"text-heading-compact-01","children":"This is a preview build of IBM Quantum® documentation."}]," ","Refer to ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline","children":"quantum.cloud.ibm.com/docs"}]," for the official documentation."]}]]}]}]}],["$","main",null,{"id":"main-content","className":"mx-16 md:mx-96 lg:mx-[56px] xlg:mx-96 pb-96 pt-0 max-w-full md:max-w-[800px]","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"prose","children":[[["$","h1",null,{"id":"qiskit-sdk-version-strategy","className":"group relative mx-0 scroll-pt-[var(--shell-top-bar-height)] [overflow-wrap:anywhere] text-heading-06 text-text-primary","children":["Qiskit SDK version strategy",["$","a",null,{"title":"Permalink to this headline","href":"#qiskit-sdk-version-strategy","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline heading-permalink ml-[8px] top-0 opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 focus:opacity-100 transition-[opacity] duration-75 ease-[cubic-bezier(0.2,0,0.38,0.9)]","children":["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","aria-hidden":true,"className":"inline","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M29.25,6.76a6,6,0,0,0-8.5,0l1.42,1.42a4,4,0,1,1,5.67,5.67l-8,8a4,4,0,1,1-5.67-5.66l1.41-1.42-1.41-1.42-1.42,1.42a6,6,0,0,0,0,8.5A6,6,0,0,0,17,25a6,6,0,0,0,4.27-1.76l8-8A6,6,0,0,0,29.25,6.76Z"}],["$","path",null,{"d":"M4.19,24.82a4,4,0,0,1,0-5.67l8-8a4,4,0,0,1,5.67,0A3.94,3.94,0,0,1,19,14a4,4,0,0,1-1.17,2.85L15.71,19l1.42,1.42,2.12-2.12a6,6,0,0,0-8.51-8.51l-8,8a6,6,0,0,0,0,8.51A6,6,0,0,0,7,28a6.07,6.07,0,0,0,4.28-1.76L9.86,24.82A4,4,0,0,1,4.19,24.82Z"}],"$undefined"]}]}]]}],"\n",["$","p",null,{"children":["Qiskit version numbers follow ",["$","a",null,{"href":"https://semver.org/","className":"text-link-primary no-underline hover:underline inline","target":"_blank","rel":"noopener nofollow noreferrer","children":["Semantic Versioning",["$","svg",null,{"focusable":"false","preserveAspectRatio":"xMidYMid meet","fill":"currentColor","aria-label":"(opens in a new tab)","width":16,"height":16,"viewBox":"0 0 32 32","role":"img","className":"inline ml-2","xmlns":"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg","children":[["$","path",null,{"d":"M10 6L10 8 22.59 8 6 24.59 7.41 26 24 9.41 24 22 26 22 26 6 10 6z"}],"$undefined"]}]]}],".\nThe version number is comprised of three primary components: the major, minor, and\npatch versions.
